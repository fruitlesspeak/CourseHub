# Project Summary
**CourseHub** is a course platform for students that brings learning and community feedback into one platform. CourseHub targets a common problem: students often rely on scattered external resources, but learning platforms deliver content that lack transparent peer reviews, rating platforms provide opinions but don’t deliver courses, and campus LMS tools have limited discovery and no rating system.

**CourseHub combines the three core capabilities into one platform:**
- Course creation and delivery
- Community ratings and reviews
- Personalized progress tracking

### Our vision
Help students discover high quality learning content while empowering instructors to share knowledge.

### Stakeholders
- Main Users: Professors/Instructors and Students.
- Secondary Users: Course Administrators (e.g., academic institutions).
- Developers: 5-member development team.
